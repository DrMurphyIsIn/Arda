  AxiomGuard — CI kernel-axiom guard for the Brualdi–Goldwasser formalization.

  This file is NOT part of the `R3Cert` library (it is a top-level module, not
  root-imported and not matched by any lakefile glob). CI runs it explicitly with

      lake env lean AxiomGuard.lean

  AFTER `lake build`, and fails the build if any listed `#print axioms` output
  mentions `sorryAx` — i.e. if a guarded theorem secretly depends on a `sorry`.

  `#print axioms` is the authoritative, false-positive-free detector: a grep for
  the string `sorry` over `.lean` sources cannot distinguish a real proof gap from
  docstring prose like "no `sorry`", but the kernel's axiom trace can.

  A clean proof reports exactly `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

  Anchors (the theorems whose integrity actually matters):
    * R3Cert.Step3.conjecture1_of_layers  — the R7' top capstone (conditional on
      the two open layers Hnorm/Hdom); guarding it guards its entire dependency cone.
    * R3Cert.phi_le_one                    — the Φ ≤ 1 analytic crux.
    * R3Cert.CappedJointConfig.gstep_le_one_achievable — the g-step / master ineq crux.
