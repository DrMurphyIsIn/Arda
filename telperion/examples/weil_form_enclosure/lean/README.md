# weil_form_enclosure — the E8 Weil pairing, evaluated and kernel-consumed

`conjecture1_proved = False`. Nothing here is a step toward RH.

## What this island is

The registry node `RH_limit_explicit_formula` (routes-roadmap **E8** = B6 = D6) is PROVED, on the
`rvm_bridge` island, against Anthropic's zeta-23-lean:

```lean
theorem limit_explicit_formula (g : ℝ → ℂ) (hg : WeilExplicit.IsWeilTest g) :
    Integrable (WeilExplicit.archIntegrand g) ∧
    HasSum (fun ρ : ℂ => (WeilExplicit.zeroMult ρ : ℂ) * WeilExplicit.weilKernel g ρ)
      (WeilExplicit.archSide g - WeilExplicit.primeSide g)
```

It says the sum over the zeros EQUALS `archSide g − primeSide g`. Until now nothing in Telperion
ever computed that right-hand side. This island does: `telperion.weil_form_eval` evaluates it with
rigorous Arb ball arithmetic for concrete members of the registered test class, and the
`weil_form_enclosure` emitter writes the Lean.

## The trust seam, stated plainly

The emitted theorems **never assert** the Arb numbers. Each carries the enclosure as a named
hypothesis `henc : lo ≤ (weilForm (crossCorr g g')).re ∧ … ≤ hi`, and the kernel proves only what
follows from it — exactly the `hexp` discipline of `BraggDefect.lean` and the `henc` discipline of
the Li ladder. python-flint (Arb) is the documented NON-KERNEL input. `AxiomGuardWeilForm.lean`
certifies the derivations are `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`-clean, which says nothing
about the enclosures themselves.

## What the three emitted theorems say

* `weil_autocorr_pos_bump_w1`, `weil_autocorr_pos_bump_w3o2` — the pairing of the autocorrelation
  of a concrete `C_c^∞` bump is strictly positive. This is what RH **predicts** (Weil positivity);
  observing it confirms nothing, because positivity over *every* admissible test function is
  RH-equivalent and two bumps are not "every".
* `weil_gram_minor_0_1` — the `2 × 2` Weil-Gram block of the two bumps has both leading principal
  minors positive, so by Sylvester it is positive definite. Worst-case determinant over the three
  enclosure boxes: ≈ `+6.19e−10`.
* `weil_negative_refutes_rh` (prelude) — the falsifiable direction. A certified strictly NEGATIVE
  autocorrelation pairing refutes RH, *through* the undischarged hypothesis
  `hpos : RiemannHypothesis → 0 ≤ (weilForm (autocorr g)).re` (the classical Weil direction, never
  proved here). It is not expected to fire; it exists so the ladder is an experiment that could
  have falsified rather than a confirmation-only ritual.

## Build

The lakefile pins Mathlib `v4.32.0`, the same pin as the sibling `quasicrystal` and
`zeta_zero_localization` islands, so the `.lake` build cache is shared.
