/- PHASE 4 (dVP frontier, BLASCHKE step 1 — DENSITY DISCHARGE): a codiscrete subset of the closed
   ball is dense within the boundary sphere.

   `DlvpBlaschkeSphere.norm_eq_of_codiscrete_factor_on_sphere` isolated one hypothesis: the
   agreement set of the codiscrete factorization is DENSE in `sphere 0 R`.  This file discharges it.

   The sphere is CONNECTED (`isConnected_sphere`, since `ℂ` has real rank 2) and nontrivial
   (`R > 0`), hence PREPERFECT (`IsPreconnected.preperfect_of_nontrivial`): every sphere point is an
   accumulation point of the sphere.  A codiscrete set `A` on `closedBall` satisfies `A ∪ (closedBall)ᶜ
   ∈ 𝓝[≠] z`; restricted to the punctured sphere (⊆ `closedBall`), this means `A` holds on the
   accumulating punctured-sphere filter — so every sphere point is a cluster point of `A ∩ sphere`,
   i.e. `sphere ⊆ closure (A ∩ sphere)`.  Function-agnostic.  conjecture1_proved = False (NOT RH).
