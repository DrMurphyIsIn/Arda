/- PHASE 4 (dVP frontier, the CENTRE→EVALUATION-POINT transfer — item 3, the sole remaining hard core):
   bound the entire part `logDeriv g` at an INTERIOR point `z₀`, not just the centre.

   `DlvpBCDeriv.norm_deriv_le_of_re_le` bounds `‖logDeriv g c‖` at the disk CENTRE.  The dVP BC-SUM
   (`bc_sum_blaschke`) needs `‖logDeriv g z₀‖` at the EVALUATION point `z₀` (off-centre, `Re ≈ 1`).
   Borel–Carathéodory turns the one-sided oscillation bound `log‖g w‖ - log‖g c‖ ≤ M'` on `ball c R`
   into a TWO-sided value bound `‖h w - h c‖ ≤ 2M'‖w-c‖/(R-‖w-c‖)` (`h = log g`, `Re h = log‖g‖`), for
   EVERY interior `w` — not just on one sphere.  A Cauchy estimate on the sphere `‖w - z₀‖ = (R-ρ)/2`
   (`ρ = ‖z₀-c‖`), which lies inside `ball c R`, then bounds the derivative at `z₀`:

     `‖logDeriv g z₀‖ ≤ 4 M' (R + ρ) / (R - ρ)²`.

   The `2M'‖w‖/(R-‖w‖)` value bound is increasing in `‖w‖`, so on that sphere it is `≤ 2M'(R+ρ)/(R-ρ)`;
   dividing by the Cauchy radius `(R-ρ)/2` gives the stated constant.  With `M' = O(L)` and `ρ, R = O(1)`
   this is `O(L)` — exactly `bc_sum_blaschke`'s `Bg`.  conjecture1_proved = False (NOT a proof of RH).
