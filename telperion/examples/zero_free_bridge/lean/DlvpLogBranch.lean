/- PHASE 4 (dVP frontier, obligation (i-b') FOUNDATION): the analytic log branch of a
   zero-free function on a disk.

   The entire part `E = logDeriv g = g'/g` (from obligation (i-a)) is bounded via
   Borel-Caratheodory + Cauchy, but BC works with the REAL PART of a holomorphic function,
   and Cauchy bounds a DERIVATIVE by VALUES.  Both need `E` realised as the derivative of an
   analytic `h` with `Re h = log‖g‖`.  On a DISK a zero-free holomorphic `g` admits exactly
   such an `h` (a global branch of `log g`), built here WITHOUT the covering-map machinery:

     * `logDeriv g = g'/g` is holomorphic on the disk (denominator nonvanishing), so by Morera
       (`DifferentiableOn.isExactOn_ball`) it has a PRIMITIVE `h` with `h' = logDeriv g`;
     * pin `h c = Complex.log (g c)`;
     * `φ = g · exp(-h)` has `φ' = exp(-h)·(g' - g·(g'/g)) = 0`, so `φ` is constant on the
       convex disk, `= φ c = g c / g c = 1`; hence `exp∘h = g`;
     * `‖g‖ = ‖exp h‖ = exp(Re h)` gives `Re h = log‖g‖`.

   Output packages `h` differentiable, `deriv h = logDeriv g`, `exp∘h = g`, `Re h = log‖g‖` —
   the object BC and Cauchy consume to bound `‖E‖ ≤ A·L`.  Function-agnostic (any analytic
   zero-free `g`).  conjecture1_proved = False (NOT a proof of RH).

/-- **Analytic log branch on a disk.**  A holomorphic zero-free `g` on `ball c r` admits an
    analytic branch `h` of `log g`: `h` is (pointwise) differentiable with derivative
    `logDeriv g`, `exp (h z) = g z`, and `(h z).re = Real.log ‖g z‖`, normalised by
    `h c = log (g c)`. -/
