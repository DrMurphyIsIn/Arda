  Hodge1_RHReduction -- the honest frontier after HODGE-1 (rvm_bridge island, 2026-10-13).

  `rh_iff_poleFree2_outside_window5493`: RiemannHypothesis holds iff Weil positivity holds for every
  pole-free (PoleFree2) Weil test whose support is NOT contained in [-5493/10000, 5493/10000].

  Both directions use real inputs:
  * (→) RvMBridge5.rh_implies_weil_positivity (the forward half of Weil's criterion);
  * (←) a case split on the support. Supports inside the window are handled by
    `Hodge1.weil_positivity_poleFree2_window5493` (the HODGE-1 1b-B certificate, p = 2 inside); the
    rest come from the hypothesis. Then `RvMBridgePF.weil_positivity_poleFree_implies_rh` (e9's
    pole-free converse) gives RH.

  The statement shape follows peterwmurphy-e9's correction: quantifying over all supports wider than
  the window would make the window theorem unnecessary, since every compactly supported test fits in
  some wider window. Hodge1.PoleFree2 and RvMBridgePF.PoleFree are the same definition.

  This is a reformulation, not progress on RH: the right-hand side is the open content.
  conjecture1_proved = False.
