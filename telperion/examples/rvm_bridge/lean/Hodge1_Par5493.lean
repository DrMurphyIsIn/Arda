  Hodge1_Par5493 -- the parameters of the DIRECT pole-free certificate at l = 5493/10000 (2L = 1.0986,
  just below log 3 = 1.098612...; the prime comb is {2}) (HODGE-1 Phase 1b-B, 2026-10-12; design
  ~/rh-team/hodge1/D/design.md section 3(b)).

  conjecture1_proved = False.  No zeros enter.  The prime p = 2 is INSIDE the symbol:
      weilSymbol L t = Psi t - c2 cos(t log 2),  c2 = 2 Lambda(2)/sqrt 2,
  and the pole coefficient 2 eps of KWin2 is replaced by the penalty pc = 1000 (on the two-condition
  pole-free class every parity piece has vanishing pole functional, so the penalty is free).  The strip
  block of Hodge1_KPen is switched off (w2up = 0, s0 = 0, no leakage matrix).

  Choices (generator ../hodge1/hodge1_gen.py h5493, exact-rational mirror; output ../hodge1/h5493*.txt):
    * KWin2_Par12's data (T = 40, beta0 = 1057/1250 <= betaStar = 0.845744, S0 = 7.23, the 11-piece
      Psi_0 minorant on [0, 40] with nS = 44, the degree-<96 comb polynomial and combK, gamma <= gamUp32),
      with l = 5493/10000, Cp = 10385/10000 >= cosh(l/2), Nser = 400 (the minorant gap costs 1e-6 of the
      even head margin against Nser = 1200), Mt = 37, Mp = 8, Econst = 1e-6;
    * even sector N = 32, lam = 55/100000 (head eigenvalue 6.3071e-4); odd sector N = 31, lam = 13/1000
      (head eigenvalue 1.37858e-2); both by psdCertR at R = 60 (R = 50 already passes);
    * the certified window floor lamFloor = 5/10000;
    * NEGATIVE CONTROLS (same pipeline, must return false): lam = 631/1000000 above the even head
      eigenvalue; the comb with the prime location moved to q = 2.1 (lag log 2.1, weight 2 log 2.1/sqrt 2.1;
      even head eigenvalue -0.0716); the comb weight 1.05 c2 (even head eigenvalue -0.00684).  The fake
      controls keep beta0 = 1057/1250 (optimistic for them: their own betaStar is smaller), so a `false`
      is a strict failure.
  No `sorry`.
