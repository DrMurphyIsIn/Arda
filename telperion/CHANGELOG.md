## 0.1.0 (2026-08-15/16) — extraction + hardening

Born from the Brualdi–Goldwasser campaign (`../proof/`), where the pattern
produced 200+ CI-green Mathlib theorems.

**Core**: `InequalityFamily` (direct + bilinear-box), `certify()` with
structural refusals, three emitter kinds (Polya batches, ℕ-reparam adapters,
`interval_cases` assemblies), enforced certify→validate→emit→freeze workflow,
input-hash provenance, byte-stable rendering across sympy versions.

**Hardening round 1**: `diagnose` refusal triage (FALSE with exact witness /
NOT_POLYA with remedy hints / CERTIFIABLE); structural lint gate inside
`emit()`; `ShardSpec` file sharding with cross-shard imports; `telperion.toml`
manifest + `verify` drift net (fails on unlisted generate scripts);
fuzz/property tests.

**Hardening round 2**: `safe_parse_expr` token whitelist on every
string-taking surface (CLI probe/diagnose, MCP tools) — sympy's parser is
never fed raw input; `telperion init` project scaffolding (family template
with the validation discipline built in, pinned Lean shell, drift manifest,
lean-verify workflow); `certify(progress=)` + `certify -v` for long runs;
path-hashed module loading (family.py can't shadow installed modules);
`CustomAssemblyEmitter` escape hatch for hand-designed assemblies.

**Named open items** (deliberately not shipped as stubs): `python-flint` fast
path (sympy expand/together dominates the profile, so a flint coefficient pass
would be decorative until the conversion layer is done properly);
bilinear-family built-in assembly (use `CustomAssemblyEmitter`); Kind-3
multi-axis grids.
