## 0.1.0 (2026-08-15/16) — extraction + hardening

Born from the Brualdi–Goldwasser campaign (`../proof/`), where the pattern
produced 200+ CI-green Mathlib theorems.

**Core**: `InequalityFamily` (direct + bilinear-box), `certify()` with
structural refusals, three emitter kinds (Polya batches, ℕ-reparam adapters,
`interval_cases` assemblies), enforced certify→validate→emit→freeze workflow,
input-hash provenance, byte-stable rendering across sympy versions.

**Hardening round 1**: `diagnose` refusal triage (FALSE with exact witness /
NOT_POLYA with remedy hints / CERTIFIABLE); structural lint gate inside
`emit()`; `ShardSpec` file sharding with cross-shard imports; `telperion.toml`
manifest + `verify` drift net (fails on unlisted generate scripts);
fuzz/property tests.

**Hardening round 2**: `safe_parse_expr` token whitelist on every
string-taking surface (CLI probe/diagnose, MCP tools) — sympy's parser is
never fed raw input; `telperion init` project scaffolding (family template
with the validation discipline built in, pinned Lean shell, drift manifest,
lean-verify workflow); `certify(progress=)` + `certify -v` for long runs;
path-hashed module loading (family.py can't shadow installed modules);
`CustomAssemblyEmitter` escape hatch for hand-designed assemblies.

**The Pólya engine**: `polya_lift` (multiply through by `(1+Σxᵢ)^N` — Pólya's
theorem as an algorithm; certifies strict positivity, provably cannot converge
at equality cases) integrated as `family.auto_lift` / `polya_certify(lift_max)`;
recursive box subdivision (`auto_subdivide` on corner refusals,
`force_subdivide` to isolate tie regions) producing leaf cells plus
`SubdivisionGlueEmitter`'s `le_total` case-split glue reconstructing the
original cell theorem; diagnose now reports the exact lift exponent when one
exists, and names the tie obstruction when none does.  Toy example gains
ToyLift and ToySplit — both new shapes compile against pinned Mathlib in CI.

**Tie-variety extraction + margins** (`margins.py`, CLI `margins`/`ties`, MCP
tools): the exact equality cases of every certificate — combinatorial tie
faces via minimal hitting sets for certified (nonneg-coefficient) numerators
(with the structural corollary: certified instances have no interior ties,
which is exactly why interior-tie claims need the arithmetic treatment),
exact real roots for refused univariate claims; per-certificate margin reports
(constant-term floor + exact-rational sample minimum with argmin), tight
instances first.  diagnose now names the tie points when lifting fails.

**Wishlist 3–7**: `telperion latex` — paper appendix / leanblueprint nodes
stamped with the SAME input hash as the Lean (sync checkable by comparing two
hex strings); symbolic-tail families (`TailFrom` axis: finite table + one
``K = K₀ + t`` certificate, `TailNatEmitter` emitting the ℕ-quantified
``∀ K ≥ K₀`` theorem; the certifier's integrality check even catches int/int
float contamination in user targets); exact SOS certificates for the
rationalizable subset (even powers + iterated quadratic completion — reaches
interior-tie shapes lifting cannot; surfaced via diagnose); CAS-neutral
certificate interchange (JSON with expression ASTs + a PURE-stdlib
`recheck.py` — coefficient signs, factor positivity, Schwartz–Zippel identity
spot-checks in `fractions` — a third independent verifier beside sympy and the
Lean kernel); `certify(workers=N)` fork-parallel certification;
`telperion package` reviewer bundles (family + frozen + certificates.json +
standalone rechecker + generated REVIEWING.md).

**Named open items** (deliberately not shipped as stubs): `python-flint` fast
path (sympy expand/together dominates the profile, so a flint coefficient pass
would be decorative until the conversion layer is done properly);
bilinear-family built-in assembly (use `CustomAssemblyEmitter`); Kind-3
multi-axis grids; the SOS Lean-emitter path (certificates found by sos.py are
surfaced in diagnose but not yet emitted — needs a squares-aware skeleton);
incremental per-instance certification caching; bilinear tails.
