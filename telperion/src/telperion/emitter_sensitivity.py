"""Emitter-wide certificate-sensitivity registry — Telperion pointed at its own
emitter set (Vector 2a of the self-application program).

`nonvacuity.assert_certificate_sensitive` proves an emitted identity is
LOAD-BEARING: corrupt the certificate and the claim must break.  It is the
semantic complement to the structural reflexive-statement check.  Today only the
WZ emitter invokes it — yet many emitters carry a corruptible identity
certificate (`linear_combination`/`ring` shapes: cone, Putinar, Handelman,
Nullstellensatz, consequence, …).

This module makes each emitter's stance EXPLICIT and ENFORCED, so the property
"every emitter has declared whether its certificate is load-bearing" becomes a
standing CI gate rather than tribal knowledge:

  * CERTIFICATE_SENSITIVE   — carries an identity certificate whose corruption
                              must break the claim; `assert_certificate_sensitive`
                              is the right guard.  `checked_in` names the module
                              that actually invokes it (truthfully verified), or
                              is None for "declared-but-not-yet-wired" — naming
                              the gap honestly instead of papering over it.
  * STRUCTURALLY_NONVACUOUS — a positivity / decidable / finite-cover / glue /
                              adapter shape with no separately-supplied
                              corruptible identity; the structural reflexive check
                              plus the kernel suffice.

No emitter file is modified: this is an additive meta-layer.  A newly-added
Emitter subclass fails `test_certificate_sensitivity` until its stance is
declared here.
