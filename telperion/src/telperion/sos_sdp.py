"""SDP-based SOS certificates with complementary-slackness duality — the LP -> SDP
upgrade of Telperion's certifier.

Polya certificates are the LP-feasibility special case: a nonnegative combination
of known-nonnegative forms.  The established extremal-combinatorics toolkit (the
occupancy method; flag algebras; "SOS for limits of trees") is the SDP layer:
certify `p >= 0` by a POSITIVE-SEMIDEFINITE Gram matrix, `p = mᵀ Q m` over a
monomial basis `m`, with two things the LP layer cannot give:

  * REACH: an SDP finds Gram matrices with off-diagonal coupling, so it certifies
    polynomials that vanish at INTERIOR points (the tie shapes) -- exactly the
    class Polya lifting provably cannot handle;
  * DUALITY / COMPLEMENTARY SLACKNESS: the kernel of the optimal `Q` is the tight
    monomial relation, so the equality variety (`p = 0`) is read off the
    certificate AUTOMATICALLY -- the SDP dual "lands on the tie" for free.

This solves the SDP numerically (cvxpy), rationalizes the Gram matrix, verifies
`p = mᵀ Q m` EXACTLY over the rationals (refusing if rationalization is inexact --
the trust model is unchanged: a bad certificate fails, never lies), LDLᵀ-factors
`Q` into an exact rational SOS, and reports the tight variety from `ker Q`.

HONEST SCOPE: this is the certificate LAYER the occupancy / SOS-for-trees method
runs on.  Applying it to the ∏deg-normalized matching functional's recursive tree
profile -- so the dual lands on the integer tie s=5 -- is the named research
program (unbounded degree + arithmetic tie), not a one-shot emission.

FINDER ROUTE DECISION (2026-08-20).  `find_putinar_certificate` upgrades the
Putinar/constrained-SOS emitter from CHECKER to SEARCHER.  We took ROUTE A (numeric
SDP -> exact rational rounding), which the local toolchain supports: cvxpy 1.7.5 is
installed with the CLARABEL and SCS solvers (no `csdp` binary on PATH, but cvxpy's
own interior-point solvers stand in for it), and sympy 1.14 gives exact rational
LDLᵀ / identity checking.  This mirrors leanprover/sos's own pipeline -- reify ->
SDP -> round the float Gram matrix to rationals (a denominator ladder) -> LDLᵀ
decomposition -> a certificate re-checked INDEPENDENTLY of the solver -- but entirely
inside Telperion's own exact-rational stack (`certify_putinar_point` is the kernel-
independent gate, exactly as `Certificate.checks` is on the Lean side).  Route B
(a DSOS/diagonally-dominant LP fallback, fully exact and numerics-free) was NOT
needed since Route A is runnable today; it remains the honest degradation path if
the SDP stack ever disappears.  As with `find_handelman_certificate`, the finder is
UNTRUSTED: every certificate it returns is re-verified EXACTLY by the existing
`certify_putinar_point` before any Lean is emitted, and a search miss is a REFUSAL,
never a wrong theorem.

sos_witness BRIDGE ASSESSMENT.  leanprover/sos exposes a `by sos?` mode that reports
its witness as a frozen `sos_witness` invocation; emitting `sos_witness`-compatible
goals would mean taking leanprover/sos as a `lake` dependency (Mathlib4 + hex-mv-poly
+ csdp-ffi + a system BLAS/LAPACK runtime) and letting THEIR tactic close the goal at
audit-compile time.  That imports a native-FFI toolchain (the `csdp-ffi` linking work
their `investigations/native-linking-repro/` tree documents) into our audit-compiles
gate, which currently needs only Mathlib -- a real portability and reproducibility
cost.  The self-contained path built here avoids that entirely: we emit ordinary
`ring`/`positivity`/`linarith` Lean that any plain-Mathlib checkout compiles, and keep
the SDP strictly on the (untrusted, Python-side) FINDER, never in the trusted checker.
Recommendation: stay self-contained; revisit the `sos_witness` bridge only if a target
goal is out of reach of our exact rounding but within leanprover/sos's rank-deficient
facial-reduction path.
